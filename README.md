The Online-Attendance Management System with Face Recognition is a Python-based project that automates the attendance-taking process using facial recognition technology. This system allows you to register individuals by capturing their facial features and then recognize them during online meetings to track attendance. This project simplifies and streamlines the attendance tracking process by eliminating the need for manual record-keeping.
